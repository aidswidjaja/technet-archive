You can see a live example of how TechNet is being used here.\r\nHow can I get TechNet for my online community?\r\nRepresentatives of online communities can send me a DM on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805) or Reddit (u/airswidjaja).

As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.</p>\r\n<p>These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Background</li>\r\n<li>Family status</li>\r\n<li>Gender</li>\r\n<li>Gender identity or expression</li>\r\n<li>Marital status</li>\r\n<li>Sex</li>\r\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\r\n<li>Native language</li>\r\n<li>Age</li>\r\n<li>Ability</li>\r\n<li>Race and/or ethnicity</li>\r\n<li>Caste</li>\r\n<li>National origin</li>\r\n<li>Socioeconomic status</li>\r\n<li>Religion</li>\r\n<li>Geographic location</li>\r\n<li>Any other dimension of diversity</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-when-and-how-to-use-\"><h2>When and How to Use These Guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as users of OSCAR TechNet, including in:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>published content;</li>\r\n<li>the Comments section;</li>\r\n<li>user profiles;</li>\r\n<li>and any use of OSCAR\'s information technology systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>While these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at interaction on TechNet, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of OSCAR’s online spaces to have a deep impact on community health. This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-expected-behavior-th\"><h2>Expected Behavior</h2>\r\n<p>The following behaviors are expected of all users of OSCAR TechNet:</p>\r\n<h3>Be Respectful</h3>\r\n<p>Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.</p>\r\n<h3>Be Direct but Professional</h3>\r\n<p>We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.</p>\r\n<h3>Be Inclusive</h3>\r\n<p>Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.</p>\r\n<p>Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Remote (on video or phone)</li>\r\n<li>Not native language speakers</li>\r\n<li>Coming from a different culture</li>\r\n<li>Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”</li>\r\n<li>Living in a different time zone</li>\r\n<li>Facing other challenges to participate</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand Different Perspectives</h3>\r\n<p>Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.</p>\r\n<h3>Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences</h3>\r\n<p>We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.</p>\r\n<h3>Lead by Example</h3>\r\n<p>By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-behavior-that-will-n\"><h2>Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated</h2>\r\n<p>The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.</p>\r\n<h3>Violence and Threats of Violence</h3>\r\n<p>Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.</p>\r\n<h3>Personal Attacks</h3>\r\n<p>Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.</p>\r\n<h3>Derogatory Language</h3>\r\n<p>Hurtful or harmful language related to:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Background</li>\r\n<li>Family status</li>\r\n<li>Gender</li>\r\n<li>Gender identity or expression</li>\r\n<li>Marital status</li>\r\n<li>Sex</li>\r\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\r\n<li>Native language</li>\r\n<li>Age</li>\r\n<li>Ability</li>\r\n<li>Race and/or ethnicity</li>\r\n<li>Caste</li>\r\n<li>National origin</li>\r\n<li>Socioeconomic status</li>\r\n<li>Religion</li>\r\n<li>Geographic location</li>\r\n<li>Other attributes</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.</p>\r\n<h3>Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact</h3>\r\n<p>Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos.

Last updated 24 June 2020.\r\nBy using the OSCAR TechNet service you agree to the latest version of these Community Guidelines.\r\nOSCAR TechNet welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.\r\nThese guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nAny other dimension of diversity\r\n\nOpenness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.\r\nWhen and How to Use These Guidelines\r\nThese guidelines outline our behavior expectations as users of OSCAR TechNet, including in:\r\n\npublished content;\r\nthe Comments section;\r\nuser profiles;\r\nand any use of OSCAR\'s information technology systems.\r\n\nWhile these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at interaction on TechNet, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of OSCAR’s online spaces to have a deep impact on community health. This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nThe following behaviors are expected of all users of OSCAR TechNet:\r\nBe Respectful\r\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\r\nBe Direct but Professional\r\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\r\nBe Inclusive\r\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\r\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\r\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\r\nNot native language speakers\r\nComing from a different culture\r\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\r\nLiving in a different time zone\r\nFacing other challenges to participate\r\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\r\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\r\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\r\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\r\nWe all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\r\nLead by Example\r\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.\r\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\r\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\r\nViolence and Threats of Violence\r\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.\r\nPersonal Attacks\r\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\r\nDerogatory Language\r\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nOther attributes\r\n\nis not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.\r\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\r\nUnwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.\r\nDisruptive Behavior\r\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\r\n\n‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.\r\nDrinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.\r\nMaking derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.\r\nOtherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.\r\n\nInfluencing Unacceptable Behavior\r\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\r\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior\r\nBad behavior from any user, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from OSCAR TechNet are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.\r\nReports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.\r\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.\r\nOSCAR Staff are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to OSCAR’s internal policies. OSCAR Staff in violation of these guidelines may be subject to further consequences. \r\nIn addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.\r\nReporting\r\nIf you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please contact us using the Contact Details below.\r\nAfter receiving a concise description of your situation, we will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately address each situation.\r\nPlease also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.\r\nIf you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.\r\nAsk questions\r\nEveryone is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines. If you are organizing an event or activity, reach out for tips building inclusion for your event, activity or space. Your input is welcome and we will try to provide a response within 2 days.

As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.\r\nThese guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nAny other dimension of diversity\r\n\nOpenness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.\r\nWhen and How to Use These Guidelines\r\nThese guidelines outline our behavior expectations as users of OSCAR TechNet, including in:\r\n\npublished content;\r\nthe Comments section;\r\nuser profiles;\r\nand any use of OSCAR\'s information technology systems.\r\n\nWhile these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at interaction on TechNet, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of OSCAR’s online spaces to have a deep impact on community health. This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nThe following behaviors are expected of all users of OSCAR TechNet:\r\nBe Respectful\r\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\r\nBe Direct but Professional\r\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\r\nBe Inclusive\r\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\r\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\r\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\r\nNot native language speakers\r\nComing from a different culture\r\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\r\nLiving in a different time zone\r\nFacing other challenges to participate\r\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\r\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\r\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\r\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\r\nWe all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\r\nLead by Example\r\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.\r\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\r\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\r\nViolence and Threats of Violence\r\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.\r\nPersonal Attacks\r\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\r\nDerogatory Language\r\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nOther attributes\r\n\nis not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.\r\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\r\nUnwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.\r\nDisruptive Behavior\r\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\r\n\n‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.\r\nDrinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.\r\nMaking derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.\r\nOtherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.\r\n\nInfluencing Unacceptable Behavior\r\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\r\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior\r\nBad behavior from any user, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from OSCAR TechNet are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.\r\nReports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.\r\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.\r\nOSCAR Staff are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to OSCAR’s internal policies. OSCAR Staff in violation of these guidelines may be subject to further consequences.\r\nIn addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.\r\nReporting\r\nIf you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please contact us using the Contact Details below.\r\nAfter receiving a concise description of your situation, we will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately address each situation.\r\nPlease also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.\r\nIf you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.\r\nAsk questions\r\nEveryone is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines. If you are organizing an event or activity, reach out for tips building inclusion for your event, activity or space. Your input is welcome and we will try to provide a response within 2 days. Please feel free to contact us using the Contact Details below.\r\nLicense and attribution\r\nThis set of guidelines is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, and has been licensed and adapted from Mozilla\'s Community Participation Guidelines.\r\nThese guidelines have been adapted with modifications from Mozilla’s original Community Participation Guidelines, the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, Mozilla’s View Source Conference Code of Conduct, and the Rust Language Code of Conduct, which are based on Stumptown Syndicate’s Citizen Code of Conduct.

While we can\'t mention the specifics (to prevent others from gaining information that could be used to break into our systems), we do:\r\n\nhash your passwords;\r\nuse the official Discord API when authenticating with Discord;\r\nblock ports apart from HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443);\r\nprovide HTTPS (with a certificate provided by Let\'s Encrypt);\r\nsubscribe to security alerts from the base application, BookStack; and\r\n\nThat being said, you need to be aware that security issues can be present from either:\r\n\nmisconfiguration(s) of security settings;\r\nupstream issues with the base application, BookStack; and\r\nother unforeseen events.\r\n\nWe have no intention of absolving ourselves from a security compromise on our systems. But we\'ve produced this document so you can make better informed decisions on how to stay safe, particularly on TechNet.\r\nThat\'s why, especially on our systems, it\'s really important to take the following security measures:\r\n\nUse a different password than you use for other websites.\r\n\nA man-in-the-middle attack could easily interpret a password, but we\'ve mitigated this risk with HTTPS encryption.\r\n\n\r\nEnsure that you\'re connected with HTTPS.\r\n\nLearn more here: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThe following constitutes our GDPR notice to users in the European Union and the European Economic Area, but applies to all users worldwide.\r\nThe information we store about you\r\nWhen you sign up to TechNet, you do so by either one or two ways.\r\n\nYou sign up to TechNet directly.\r\nYou sign up via Discord.\r\n\nWhen you sign up via any of these apps, OSCAR system administrators (not community staff) can see your email address. If you\'re not comfortable with sharing your email with us, then please use a fake email address when signing up. We won\'t terminate accounts that provide fake email accounts in the interests of privacy. However, this means that you won\'t be able to recover your account if you forget your password.\r\nIf you connect your account to Discord, we can see your email address and username.\r\nHowever, we can\'t see your password, since it is hashed using industry-standard encryption.\r\nWe might also store other information about you like your IP addresses, general location (city/country) and computer information, and this is stored on our servers.\r\nWhat we might store on your computer\r\nBecause of the base application BookStack, we might store cookies on your computer, for example, to keep you signed in.\r\nIf you don\'t want to use cookies, use Private Browsing, which will clear all history and cookies upon closing the window.\r\nThanks for trusting us with your data. We promise to do our best to keep it safe, but it\'s important for you to know that the risks are higher here than elsewhere. We accept full responsibility for security compromises that impact you and will do our best to resolve security incidents, but we ask that you take some basic security steps to protect yourself online.',3,'2020-06-24 12:19:00','2020-06-24 12:19:00','security-policy','policies','version','','',2),(20,7,'Known issues','<h5 id=\"bkmrk-here-are-technical-b\"><strong>Here are technical bugs with our platform that we\'re currently aware of.

This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-expected-behavior-th\"><h2>Expected Behavior</h2>\r\n<p>The following behaviors are expected of all users of OSCAR TechNet:</p>\r\n<h3>Be Respectful</h3>\r\n<p>Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.</p>\r\n<h3>Be Direct but Professional</h3>\r\n<p>We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.</p>\r\n<h3>Be Inclusive</h3>\r\n<p>Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.</p>\r\n<p>Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Remote (on video or phone)</li>\r\n<li>Not native language speakers</li>\r\n<li>Coming from a different culture</li>\r\n<li>Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”</li>\r\n<li>Living in a different time zone</li>\r\n<li>Facing other challenges to participate</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand Different Perspectives</h3>\r\n<p>Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.</p>\r\n<h3>Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences</h3>\r\n<p>We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.</p>\r\n<h3>Lead by Example</h3>\r\n<p>By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-behavior-that-will-n\"><h2>Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated</h2>\r\n<p>The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.</p>\r\n<h3>Violence and Threats of Violence</h3>\r\n<p>Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.</p>\r\n<h3>Personal Attacks</h3>\r\n<p>Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.</p>\r\n<h3>Derogatory Language</h3>\r\n<p>Hurtful or harmful language related to:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Background</li>\r\n<li>Family status</li>\r\n<li>Gender</li>\r\n<li>Gender identity or expression</li>\r\n<li>Marital status</li>\r\n<li>Sex</li>\r\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\r\n<li>Native language</li>\r\n<li>Age</li>\r\n<li>Ability</li>\r\n<li>Race and/or ethnicity</li>\r\n<li>Caste</li>\r\n<li>National origin</li>\r\n<li>Socioeconomic status</li>\r\n<li>Religion</li>\r\n<li>Geographic location</li>\r\n<li>Other attributes</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.</p>\r\n<h3>Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact</h3>\r\n<p>Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.</p>\r\n<h3>Disruptive Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.</li>\r\n<li>Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.</li>\r\n<li>Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.</li>\r\n<li>Otherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Influencing Unacceptable Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-consequences-of-unac\"><h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>\r\n<p>Bad behavior from any user, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from OSCAR TechNet are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.</p>\r\n<p>Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.</p>\r\n<p>OSCAR Staff are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to OSCAR’s internal policies. OSCAR Staff in violation of these guidelines may be subject to further consequences.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.</p>\r\n<h3>Signing up for an account</h3>\r\n<p>Like most platforms, while anyone is free to browse and view the content published on TechNet, you should be at least <strong>13 years old, or the age of majority in your local jurisdiction (whichever is most applicable)</strong> to maintain an account on TechNet.</p>\r\n<p>Accounts that violate this rule may be terminated.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-reporting-if-you-bel\"><h2>Reporting</h2>\r\n<p>If you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please contact us using the Contact Details below.</p>\r\n<p>After receiving a concise description of your situation, we will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately address each situation.</p>\r\n<p>Please also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.</p>\r\n<p>If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-ask-questions-everyo\"><h2>Ask questions</h2>\r\n<p>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines. If you are organizing an event or activity, reach out for tips building inclusion for your event, activity or space. Your input is welcome and we will try to provide a response within 2 days.

Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.\r\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\r\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\r\nViolence and Threats of Violence\r\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.\r\nPersonal Attacks\r\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\r\nDerogatory Language\r\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nOther attributes\r\n\nis not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.\r\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\r\nUnwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.\r\nDisruptive Behavior\r\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\r\n\n‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.\r\nDrinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.\r\nMaking derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.\r\nOtherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.\r\n\nInfluencing Unacceptable Behavior\r\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\r\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior\r\nBad behavior from any user, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from OSCAR TechNet are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.\r\nReports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.\r\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.\r\nOSCAR Staff are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to OSCAR’s internal policies. OSCAR Staff in violation of these guidelines may be subject to further consequences.\r\nIn addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.\r\nSigning up for an account\r\nLike most platforms, while anyone is free to browse and view the content published on TechNet, you should be at least 13 years old, or the age of majority in your local jurisdiction (whichever is most applicable) to maintain an account on TechNet.\r\nAccounts that violate this rule may be terminated.\r\nReporting\r\nIf you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please contact us using the Contact Details below.\r\nAfter receiving a concise description of your situation, we will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately address each situation.\r\nPlease also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.\r\nIf you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.\r\nAsk questions\r\nEveryone is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines. If you are organizing an event or activity, reach out for tips building inclusion for your event, activity or space. Your input is welcome and we will try to provide a response within 2 days. Please feel free to contact us using the Contact Details below.\r\nLicense and attribution\r\nThis set of guidelines is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, and has been licensed and adapted from Mozilla\'s Community Participation Guidelines.\r\nThese guidelines have been adapted with modifications from Mozilla’s original Community Participation Guidelines, the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, Mozilla’s View Source Conference Code of Conduct, and the Rust Language Code of Conduct, which are based on Stumptown Syndicate’s Citizen Code of Conduct.

You don\'t need to sign up for an account to view anything, but if you would like feel free to.\r\nIf you have any questions, either about the content here or the support group in general, please don\'t hesitate to let me know! I\'m available on Discord as aidswidjaja#2805.\r\n\nAbout myself\r\nMy name is Adrian, but online I\'m mostly known as aidswidjaja. I\'m a 15 year old boy who lives in Sydney, Australia, and I enjoy messing around with computers, watching anime, and helping people out when they\'re in a tough time. I\'ve been on peer support communities like Outcasts for quite a while now (over a year) but have been hanging out on the internet for much longer. I spent my time on platforms like YouTube and Reddit, and when I was younger did a lot of online multiplayer gaming on Roblox. It wouldn\'t be too bad if I could do something like that again, in retrospect. I guess I\'ve really enjoyed meeting new people and having great experiences on the internet and a large part of my life is focused on giving back to the community that we all contribute to in many ways.\r\nWhile irl I\'m pretty introverted and shy online I\'m definitely more confident so feel free to talk with me anytime. That being said, you\'re probably wondering what I\'m doing running a support group on suicide and self harm.\r\nMy personal experiences with depression and suicide have been long. I won\'t go into detail, but I encountered depression at a very young age, and was eventually hospitalised for suicide. I was also homicidal, which I hid from my therapist (because I didn\'t trust them at the time) and to this day, I always think about how close I was to hurting other people.\r\nAbout a year or two ago I started recovering. Today I\'m happy to say I\'m fully recovered. That being said, I still bear the scars of my former conditions. I still get the occasional anxiety attack. I still am desensitised to death and dark thoughts. And despite my young age, I have been through a lot of things, a lot of things that not many people know about. So the reason I\'m investing this time into engaging others who have been through our shared experiences, is so that everyone can find a way out of this dark hole. I\'ve climbed out, and now I want to help other people out too.\r\nAbout this (proposed) support group\r\nThis support group is planned to operate on weekly topics, discussions, stimulus content, and maybe a few group projects, depending on how things go. The idea is to engage people into thinking about their condition(s) and how to manage it. While this support group is aimed directly at people experiencing suicide and self harm, if you\'re interested in committing to the group, and/or you have other conditions, you\'re more than welcome to join.\r\nWe\'ll be operating on Outcasts but this won\'t be a whole-server thing. Instead, you\'ll need to commit to the group (you can always leave at any time, but the idea is that this is a medium-term commitment) manually and join the discussions we have!\r\nIf you\'re interested about the sort of things we\'ll be doing, just browse through the available resources already uploaded. I\'ll be using this as a central point of resource and information for how the support group runs but the conversation and discussion will take place in Discord.\r\nThis is also very much a learning experience for me, and I\'ll be working a lot with the Outcasts Staff team to make sure everything runs smoothly, but with that being said, as a support group this means that everyone\'s encouraged to voice their opinions too.

You don\'t need to sign up for an account to view anything, but if you would like feel free to.\r\nIf you have any questions, either about the content here or the support group in general, please don\'t hesitate to let me know! I\'m available on Discord as aidswidjaja#2805.\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional, 24/7, and anonymous suicide hotline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html\r\n\nAbout myself\r\nMy name is Adrian, but online I\'m mostly known as aidswidjaja. I\'m a 15 year old boy who lives in Sydney, Australia, and I enjoy messing around with computers, watching anime, and helping people out when they\'re in a tough time. I\'ve been on peer support communities like Outcasts for quite a while now (over a year) but have been hanging out on the internet for much longer. I spent my time on platforms like YouTube and Reddit, and when I was younger did a lot of online multiplayer gaming on Roblox. It wouldn\'t be too bad if I could do something like that again, in retrospect. I guess I\'ve really enjoyed meeting new people and having great experiences on the internet and a large part of my life is focused on giving back to the community that we all contribute to in many ways.\r\nWhile irl I\'m pretty introverted and shy online I\'m definitely more confident so feel free to talk with me anytime. That being said, you\'re probably wondering what I\'m doing running a support group on suicide and self harm.\r\nMy personal experiences with depression and suicide have been long. I won\'t go into detail, but I encountered depression at a very young age, and was eventually hospitalised for suicide. I was also homicidal, which I hid from my therapist (because I didn\'t trust them at the time) and to this day, I always think about how close I was to hurting other people.\r\nAbout a year or two ago I started recovering. Today I\'m happy to say I\'m fully recovered. That being said, I still bear the scars of my former conditions. I still get the occasional anxiety attack. I still am desensitised to death and dark thoughts. And despite my young age, I have been through a lot of things, a lot of things that not many people know about. So the reason I\'m investing this time into engaging others who have been through our shared experiences, is so that everyone can find a way out of this dark hole. I\'ve climbed out, and now I want to help other people out too.\r\nIf you ever want someone to talk to, I\'m always available. Alternatively you could start a support session, or reach out to other support resources available in your area. \r\nAbout this (proposed) support group\r\nThis support group is planned to operate on weekly topics, discussions, stimulus content, and maybe a few group projects, depending on how things go. The idea is to engage people into thinking about their condition(s) and how to manage it. While this support group is aimed directly at people experiencing suicide and self harm, if you\'re interested in committing to the group, and/or you have other conditions, you\'re more than welcome to join.\r\nWe\'ll be operating on Outcasts but this won\'t be a whole-server thing. Instead, you\'ll need to commit to the group (you can always leave at any time, but the idea is that this is a medium-term commitment) manually and join the discussions we have!\r\nIf you\'re interested about the sort of things we\'ll be doing, just browse through the available resources already uploaded.

I\'m a 15 year old boy who lives in Sydney, Australia, and I enjoy messing around with computers, watching anime, and helping people out when they\'re in a tough time. I\'ve been on peer support communities like Outcasts for quite a while now (over a year) but have been hanging out on the internet for much longer. I spent my time on platforms like YouTube and Reddit, and when I was younger did a lot of online multiplayer gaming on Roblox. It wouldn\'t be too bad if I could do something like that again, in retrospect. I guess I\'ve really enjoyed meeting new people and having great experiences on the internet and a large part of my life is focused on giving back to the community that we all contribute to in many ways.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-while-irl-i%27m-pretty\">While irl I\'m pretty introverted and shy online I\'m definitely more confident so feel free to talk with me anytime. That being said, you\'re probably wondering what I\'m doing running a support group on suicide and self harm.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-my-personal-experien\">My personal experiences with depression and suicide have been long. I won\'t go into detail, but I encountered depression at a very young age, and was eventually hospitalised for suicide. I was also homicidal, which I hid from my therapist (because I didn\'t trust them at the time) and to this day, I always think about how close I was to hurting other people.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-about-a-year-or-two-\">About a year or two ago I started recovering. Today I\'m happy to say I\'m fully recovered. That being said, I still bear the scars of my former conditions. I still get the occasional anxiety attack. I still am desensitised to death and dark thoughts. And despite my young age, I have been through a lot of things, a lot of things that not many people know about. So the reason I\'m investing this time into engaging others who have been through our shared experiences, is so that everyone can find a way out of this dark hole. I\'ve climbed out, and now I want to help other people out too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"callout info\" id=\"bkmrk-if-you-ever-want-som\">If you ever want someone to talk to, I\'m always available. Alternatively you could start a support session, or reach out to other support resources available in your area. </p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-about-this-%28proposed\">About this (proposed) support group</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-this-support-group-i\">This support group is planned to operate on weekly topics, discussions, stimulus content, and maybe a few group projects, depending on how things go. The idea is to engage people into thinking about their condition(s) and how to manage it. While this support group is aimed directly at people experiencing suicide and self harm, if you\'re interested in committing to the group, and/or you have other conditions, you\'re more than welcome to join.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-we%27ll-be-operating-o\">We\'ll be operating on Outcasts but this won\'t be a whole-server thing. Instead, you\'ll need to commit to the group (you can always leave at any time, but the idea is that this is a medium-term commitment) manually and join the discussions we have!</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-if-you%27re-interested\">If you\'re interested about the sort of things we\'ll be doing, just browse through the available resources already uploaded. I\'ll be using this as a central point of resource and information for how the support group runs but the conversation and discussion will take place in Discord.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-this-is-also-very-mu\">This is also very much a learning experience for me, and I\'ll be working a lot with the Outcasts Staff team to make sure everything runs smoothly, but with that being said, as a support group this means that everyone\'s encouraged to voice their opinions too. If you think that you\'ve got something to contribute, please let me know!</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-if-you-have-any-furt\" class=\"callout info\">If you have any further questions about the group, please don\'t hesitate to contact me!

Just let me know when you sign up.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-this-group-is-best-f\">This group is best for you if:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-you%27re-interested-in\">\n<li>You\'re interested in how to manage suicide and self-harm</li>\r\n<li>You\'re interested in how to help others manage suicide and self-harm (even if you\'re mentally injured too)</li>\r\n<li>You\'re interested in the different aspects of suicide, including suicidology</li>\r\n<li>You want to learn more about supporting others</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-by-no-means-is-any-o\">By no means is any of the content here professional training. We\'ll be definitely relying on professionally-produced content, but for the most part, this is an opportunity to share &amp; discuss your experiences, as well as develop strategies and ideas for moving forward and gaining strength at a dark moment in our lives.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-a-few-ground-rules\">A few ground rules</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-because-of-the-uniqu\">Because of the unique nature of a semi-private support group, in addition to Outcasts server rules we have a few extra here:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-what%27s-said-in-the-g\">\n<li>What\'s said in the group, stays in the group. Please don\'t discuss other people\'s conditions or issues outside of our safe space. If there\'s an emergency, staff can intervene.</li>\r\n<li>Being open and respectful. We know that the vast majority of people committing to this group will be experiencing hardship in their lives. That\'s why it\'s important to be open with ourselves, and open with other people. The best way to do this is to foster respectful communication within everyone.</li>\r\n<li>Be prepared to accept you\'re wrong. We all make mistakes, and we can all be misinformed. Come to our group with an open mindset, and be prepared to be challenged about any preconceiving notions you might have. We\'re all working towards a common goal, and that\'s to make our lives better.</li>\r\n<li>Let\'s help each other out, and work towards the mission of the group. There\'s a world waiting for everyone out there, but we\'re in this group because there\'s something holding us back, most likely suicide and self harm. Let\'s work together to make sure that we fight these battles together.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-i-always-personally-\">I always personally like talking things out with people as opposed to policing and moderating people. We\'re here for you, even if you do break these rules, but please make sure that you observe server rules and our ground rules, as well as trying to be generous, committed, respectful and open online. We\'re here for you, always, but we need your help to do it.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-about-oscar-technet\">About OSCAR TechNet</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-technet-is-the-conte\">TechNet is the content management system we\'re using to host the content we need to get the conversation starting in our discussion and support groups.

That being said, you\'re probably wondering what I\'m doing running a support group on suicide and self harm.\r\nMy personal experiences with depression and suicide have been long. I won\'t go into detail, but I encountered depression at a very young age, and was eventually hospitalised for suicide. I was also homicidal, which I hid from my therapist (because I didn\'t trust them at the time) and to this day, I always think about how close I was to hurting other people.\r\nAbout a year or two ago I started recovering. Today I\'m happy to say I\'m fully recovered. That being said, I still bear the scars of my former conditions. I still get the occasional anxiety attack. I still am desensitised to death and dark thoughts. And despite my young age, I have been through a lot of things, a lot of things that not many people know about. So the reason I\'m investing this time into engaging others who have been through our shared experiences, is so that everyone can find a way out of this dark hole. I\'ve climbed out, and now I want to help other people out too.\r\nIf you ever want someone to talk to, I\'m always available. Alternatively you could start a support session, or reach out to other support resources available in your area. \r\nAbout this (proposed) support group\r\nThis support group is planned to operate on weekly topics, discussions, stimulus content, and maybe a few group projects, depending on how things go. The idea is to engage people into thinking about their condition(s) and how to manage it. While this support group is aimed directly at people experiencing suicide and self harm, if you\'re interested in committing to the group, and/or you have other conditions, you\'re more than welcome to join.\r\nWe\'ll be operating on Outcasts but this won\'t be a whole-server thing. Instead, you\'ll need to commit to the group (you can always leave at any time, but the idea is that this is a medium-term commitment) manually and join the discussions we have!\r\nIf you\'re interested about the sort of things we\'ll be doing, just browse through the available resources already uploaded. I\'ll be using this as a central point of resource and information for how the support group runs but the conversation and discussion will take place in Discord.\r\nThis is also very much a learning experience for me, and I\'ll be working a lot with the Outcasts Staff team to make sure everything runs smoothly, but with that being said, as a support group this means that everyone\'s encouraged to voice their opinions too. If you think that you\'ve got something to contribute, please let me know!\r\nIf you have any further questions about the group, please don\'t hesitate to contact me! I\'m available on Discord as aidswidjaja#2805.\r\nWho this support group is best for\r\nAnyone can join, even if you aren\'t currently experiencing this condition or you experiencing other conditions too. Just let me know when you sign up.\r\nThis group is best for you if:\r\n\nYou\'re interested in how to manage suicide and self-harm\r\nYou\'re interested in how to help others manage suicide and self-harm (even if you\'re mentally injured too)\r\nYou\'re interested in the different aspects of suicide, including suicidology\r\nYou want to learn more about supporting others\r\n\nBy no means is any of the content here professional training. We\'ll be definitely relying on professionally-produced content, but for the most part, this is an opportunity to share &amp; discuss your experiences, as well as develop strategies and ideas for moving forward and gaining strength at a dark moment in our lives.\r\nA few ground rules\r\nBecause of the unique nature of a semi-private support group, in addition to Outcasts server rules we have a few extra here:\r\n\nWhat\'s said in the group, stays in the group. Please don\'t discuss other people\'s conditions or issues outside of our safe space. If there\'s an emergency, staff can intervene.\r\nBeing open and respectful. We know that the vast majority of people committing to this group will be experiencing hardship in their lives. That\'s why it\'s important to be open with ourselves, and open with other people. The best way to do this is to foster respectful communication within everyone.\r\nBe prepared to accept you\'re wrong. We all make mistakes, and we can all be misinformed. Come to our group with an open mindset, and be prepared to be challenged about any preconceiving notions you might have. We\'re all working towards a common goal, and that\'s to make our lives better.\r\nLet\'s help each other out, and work towards the mission of the group. There\'s a world waiting for everyone out there, but we\'re in this group because there\'s something holding us back, most likely suicide and self harm. Let\'s work together to make sure that we fight these battles together.\r\n\nI always personally like talking things out with people as opposed to policing and moderating people. We\'re here for you, even if you do break these rules, but please make sure that you observe server rules and our ground rules, as well as trying to be generous, committed, respectful and open online. We\'re here for you, always, but we need your help to do it.\r\nAbout OSCAR TechNet\r\nTechNet is the content management system we\'re using to host the content we need to get the conversation starting in our discussion and support groups. You don\'t have to make an account to use it for our group but if you would like that option is available to. If you have any other queries feel free to contact me. \r\nI\'m also the sole proprietor behind TechNet (which is a non-profit initiative anyway) but the work I do here is completely separate to what I\'m doing for our support groups. \r\nInterested?\r\nFeel free to contact aidswidjaja#2805 on Discord if you are interested. We look forward to seeing you there!\r\n ',3,'2020-06-26 08:30:35','2020-06-26 08:30:35','introduction','outcasts-—-suicide-and-self-harm','version','','',5),(42,10,'Understanding suicide and self harm','<p id=\"bkmrk-welcome-to-the-first\">Welcome to the first week of our Suicide and Self Harm Discussion &amp; Support Group on The Outcasts!

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy-going topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nGetting our head around different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nOverdoses (sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. \r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\nSeverity\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at.

Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-if-you-have-any-sugg\" class=\"callout info\">If you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-do-you-need-urgent-h\" class=\"callout danger\">Do you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: <a href=\"http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html\">suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html</a><br><br>Australia: 13 11 14<br>Canada: 1883-456-4566<br>New Zealand: 0508 828 865<br>United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123<br>United States: 1800-273-8255</p>\r\n<hr id=\"bkmrk-\">\n<h3 id=\"bkmrk-getting-our-head-aro\">Understanding different conditions</h3>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-if-you-go-to-a-resou\">If you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-when-you%27re-on-onlin\">When you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-depression-and-anxie\">Depression and Anxiety</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-depression-and-anxie-0\"><code>Depression</code> and <code>anxiety</code> are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-at-the-basic-level%2C-\">At the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-depression-as-a-mood\">\n<li>Depression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-these-terms-are-ofte\">These terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-similarly%2C-anxiety-c\">Similarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-anxiety-as-an-emotio\">\n<li>Anxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.</li>\r\n<li>Anxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-no-experience-of-dep\" class=\"callout info\">No experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-suicide\">Suicide</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk--0\"><a href=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/dnOg5sfG1keGySF5-image-1593159212409.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/dnOg5sfG1keGySF5-image-1593159212409.png\" alt=\"image-1593159212409.png\" width=\"407\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-people-who-are-suici\">People who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-just-because-your-co\" class=\"callout warning\">Just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; <strong>the pain is still the same.</strong></p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-terms-to-know\">Terms to know</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-you-don%27t-need-to-re\" class=\"callout info\">You don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicidal-ideation-is\"><strong>Suicidal ideation</strong> is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just <em>thinking</em> about it to making detailed plans. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicide-survivors-ar\"><strong>Suicide survivors</strong> are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicide-attempters-a\"><strong>Suicide attempters</strong> are people who have attempted suicide. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-recovery-is-a-term-w\"><strong>Recovery</strong> is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as <strong>survivors</strong> if they attempted suicide before. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-even-people-who-have\" class=\"callout info\">Even people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-self-harm\">Self Harm</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-people-self-harm-in-\">People self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. </p>\r\n<p class=\"callout info\" id=\"bkmrk-often%2C-self-harm-in-\">Often, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-terms-to-know-0\">Common self harming methods</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-there-are-usually-pl\">There are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-cutting-is-where-an-\"><strong>Cutting</strong> is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes <strong>habitual (recurring)</strong> and it is unhealthy.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-overdoses%C2%A0%28sometimes\"><strong>Overdoses </strong>(sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-other-methods-includ\">Other methods include:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-burning-the-skin-hit\">\n<li>Burning the skin</li>\r\n<li>Hitting the body with fists or another object</li>\r\n<li>Punching walls or other objects</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-source%3A-https%3A%2F%2Fwww.\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\">https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm</a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-first-aid-informatio\" class=\"callout warning\">First Aid information:<br><br><strong>Cutting:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-wound\">https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-wound</a><strong><br></strong><strong>Overdose: </strong><a href=\"https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\">https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/</a></p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-severity\">Severity, and assessing our own conditions</h4>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-as-stated-above%2C-jus\" class=\"callout warning\">As stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-assessing-the-level-\">Assessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-even-without-a-diagn\">Even without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.</p>\r\n<blockquote id=\"bkmrk-1.-severity-of-ideat\">\r\n<h5>\n<strong>1. Severity of ideation</strong><br><strong>2. Intensity of ideation</strong><br><strong>3. Behaviour</strong><br><strong>4. Lethality</strong>\n</h5>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-alternatively%2C-if-th\">Alternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: <a href=\"https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\">https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/</a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk--1\"><a href=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/nhlyIxTjknflXuXC-image-1593161630018.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/nhlyIxTjknflXuXC-image-1593161630018.png\" alt=\"image-1593161630018.png\"></a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-%C2%A0\">When it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-soars\">SOARS</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-soars-stands-for%C2%A0sui\">SOARS stands for <strong>S</strong>uicidal ideation; <strong>O</strong>nset, Frequency and Methods;  <strong>A</strong>ftercare; <strong>R</strong>easons and <strong>S</strong>tage of Change.

That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-onset%2C-frequency-and\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Onset, Frequency and Methods</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-someone-who-cuts-3-t\">Someone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-aftercare\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Aftercare</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-the-way-you-treat-yo\">The way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-reasons\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Reasons</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-many-of-us-self-harm\">Many of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why?

Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"callout success\" id=\"bkmrk-over-to-you-now%3A%C2%A0if-\"><strong>Over to you now:</strong> <br><br><strong>If you self harm</strong>, which of these areas do you think you could improve in?

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy-going topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways.

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy-going topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor.

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy to understand topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nOverdoses (sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. \r\nOther methods include:\r\n\nBurning the skin\r\nHitting the body with fists or another object\r\nPunching walls or other objects\r\n\nSource: https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\nSeverity, and assessing our own conditions\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at.

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy to understand topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nOverdoses (sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. \r\nOther methods include:\r\n\nBurning the skin\r\nHitting the body with fists or another object\r\nPunching walls or other objects\r\n\nSource: https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\n\nSeverity, and assessing our own conditions\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.\r\n\r\n\n1. Severity of ideation2. Intensity of ideation3. Behaviour4. Lethality\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.\r\nOn your own, you might like to assess the severity and risk of suicide and self harm with you personally. If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.\r\n\nCase Study: SOARS\r\nThe SOARS model stands for Suicidal ideation; Onset, Frequency and Methods;  Aftercare; Reasons and Stage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.\r\nSuicidal ideation\r\nYou probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.\r\nOnset, Frequency and Methods\r\nSomeone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. \r\nAftercare\r\nThe way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. \r\nReasons\r\nMany of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?\r\nYou might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.\r\nStage of Change\r\nMany of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.\r\nOver to you now: If you self harm, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?If you don\'t self harm, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be.

Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nOverdoses (sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. \r\nOther methods include:\r\n\nBurning the skin\r\nHitting the body with fists or another object\r\nPunching walls or other objects\r\n\nSource: https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\n\nSeverity, and assessing our own conditions\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.\r\n\r\n\n1. Severity of ideation2. Intensity of ideation3. Behaviour4. Lethality\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.\r\nOn your own, you might like to assess the severity and risk of suicide and self harm with you personally. If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.\r\n\nCase Study: SOARS\r\nThe SOARS model stands for Suicidal ideation; Onset, Frequency and Methods;  Aftercare; Reasons and Stage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.\r\nSuicidal ideation\r\nYou probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.\r\nOnset, Frequency and Methods\r\nSomeone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. \r\nAftercare\r\nThe way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. \r\nReasons\r\nMany of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?\r\nYou might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.\r\nStage of Change\r\nMany of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.\r\nOver to you now: If you self harm, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?If you don\'t self harm, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be? How could you address improvements in different specific areas?Leave your ideas and be involved with the conversation in the allocated Discord channel for our group!\r\nSource: https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/soars-model-risk-assessment-nonsuicidal-self-injury\r\nOther resources\r\nhttp://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/fnssi.pdf - this is more of a questionnaire to assess your own self-harming.',3,'2020-06-27 04:55:10','2020-06-27 04:55:10','understanding-suicide-and-self-harm','outcasts-—-suicide-and-self-harm','version','','',12),(57,10,'Understanding suicide and self harm','<p id=\"bkmrk-welcome-to-the-first\">Welcome to the first week of our Suicide and Self Harm Discussion &amp; Support Group on The Outcasts!

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy to understand topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nOverdoses (sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. \r\nOther methods include:\r\n\nBurning the skin\r\nHitting the body with fists or another object\r\nPunching walls or other objects\r\n\nSource: https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\n\nSeverity, and assessing our own conditions\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.\r\n\r\n\n1. Severity of ideation2. Intensity of ideation3. Behaviour4. Lethality\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.\r\nOn your own, you might like to assess the severity and risk of suicide and self harm with you personally. If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.\r\n\nCase Study: SOARS\r\nThe SOARS model stands for Suicidal ideation; Onset, Frequency and Methods;  Aftercare; Reasons and Stage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.\r\nSuicidal ideation\r\nYou probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.\r\nOnset, Frequency and Methods\r\nSomeone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. \r\nAftercare\r\nThe way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. \r\nReasons\r\nMany of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?\r\nYou might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.\r\nStage of Change\r\nMany of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.\r\nOver to you now: If you self harm, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?If you don\'t self harm, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be? How could you address improvements in different specific areas?Leave your ideas and be involved with the conversation in the allocated Discord channel for our group!\r\nSource: https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/soars-model-risk-assessment-nonsuicidal-self-injury\r\nWe\'ll be going through risk assessment more in the future, so this is just a quick primer.

We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nOverdoses (sometimes abbreviated to OD) occur when someone deliberately intakes a drug  in order to hurt themselves. While people also attempt to overdose as part of a suicide method for example, sometimes people just overdose in order to hurt themselves. The health risks are much more serious as they could require hospitalisation, and in some cases, could end up in death. \r\nOther methods include:\r\n\nBurning the skin\r\nHitting the body with fists or another object\r\nPunching walls or other objects\r\n\nSource: https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\n\nSeverity, and assessing our own conditions\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.\r\n\r\n\n1. Severity of ideation2. Intensity of ideation3. Behaviour4. Lethality\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.\r\nOn your own, you might like to assess the severity and risk of suicide and self harm with you personally. If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.\r\n\nCase Study: SOARS\r\nThe SOARS model stands for Suicidal ideation; Onset, Frequency and Methods;  Aftercare; Reasons and Stage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.\r\nSuicidal ideation\r\nYou probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.\r\nOnset, Frequency and Methods\r\nSomeone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. \r\nAftercare\r\nThe way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. \r\nReasons\r\nMany of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?\r\nYou might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.\r\nStage of Change\r\nMany of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.\r\n\nOver to youIf you self harm, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?If you don\'t self harm, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be? How could you address improvements in different specific areas?Leave your ideas and be involved with the conversation in the allocated Discord channel for our group!\n\r\nSource: https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/soars-model-risk-assessment-nonsuicidal-self-injury\r\nWe\'ll be going through risk assessment more in the future, so this is just a quick primer.

If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.\r\n\nCase Study: SOARS\r\nThe SOARS model stands for Suicidal ideation; Onset, Frequency and Methods;  Aftercare; Reasons and Stage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.\r\nSuicidal ideation\r\nYou probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.\r\nOnset, Frequency and Methods\r\nSomeone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. \r\nAftercare\r\nThe way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. \r\nReasons\r\nMany of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?\r\nYou might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.\r\nStage of Change\r\nMany of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.\r\n\nOver to youIf you self harm, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?If you don\'t self harm, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be? How could you address improvements in different specific areas?Leave your ideas and be involved with the conversation in the allocated Discord channel for our group!\n\r\nSource: https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/soars-model-risk-assessment-nonsuicidal-self-injury\r\nWe\'ll be going through risk assessment more in the future, so this is just a quick primer.

Put the Lifeline number, 1-800-273-8255, into your phone.\r\n\nEnsure your environment is safe: Have you thought of ways in which you might harm yourself? Work with a counselor to develop a plan to limit your access to these means.\r\n\n\r\n\nPlanning ahead is a great idea!

Am I always in the same place or with a particular person when I get the urge to injure myself?<br>• Do I always feel the same emotion when I get the urge to injure myself?<br>• How can I better deal with the situations that trigger me? <br>You may want to keep a diary in which you write down your feelings at different times so that you can better answer these questions.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I want to stop self-injuring but I still have urges. What do I do instead?</strong></span><br><br>Distract yourself or use a substitution behavior. Many report that just delaying an urge to self-injure by several minutes can be enough to make the urge fade away. One way to increase the chances of a distraction or substitution helping calm the urge to self-injure is to match what you do to how you are feeling at the moment. It may be helpful to keep a list on hand so that when you get the urge to self-injure you can go down the list and find something that feels right to you in the moment.<br><br><br><em>Source: http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/distraction-techniques-pm-2.pdf</em>\n</h5>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-%C2%A0-0\"> </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-%C2%A0-1\"> </p>','There are a number of resources available to people who suffer from suicide or self harm.

You may feel less isolated when you’re connected more to others. Consider joining an interest group, volunteering, taking a class, or starting a new hobby.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Social Networks\r\nSocial media is a place to share how you’re feeling and hear the stories of others who have felt the same. Connecting to people through technology may help you remember that you are not alone, and you may find others with similar interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Community\r\nWhether your community is at work, school, church, or a club or a team, having a group of people who encourage help-seeking and support  is one of the most important aspects of suicide prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Circle Of Trust\r\nRelationships with friends, family, and significant others built on trust and companionship are a protective factor against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. It’s important to find the people in your life that you can always confide in, feel comfortable around, and can contact at any time. Surround yourself with positive people who motivate you to be your best.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nWhat support networks do you have available to you now? Who do you trust, and in which areas would you like to improve?\r\nUse Your Support Network\r\nLeaning on your support network can help you cope during difficult moments and is an important step in getting help and moving forward.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nExpress Yourself\r\nDuring difficult situations, it’s natural to shut down, but keeping your emotions bottled up makes it harder for your support network to help you. Reach out to people you trust who have the ability to be sympathetic and non-judgmental.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep an Open Mind\r\nKeep in mind that the advice and support of others come from a good place. We may not necessarily agree with advice we’re given, but staying open-minded and receptive to outside perspectives and opinions can help strengthen your support network.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Appreciation\r\nThe people in your support network will stick with you through thick and thin, but it’s also important to remember that friendships and relationships are a two-way street. Express your appreciation for the love and support that these special people bring into your life.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThis is really important too. Many of us would also have experienced hardships and frustrations when supporting others sometimes, and even just showing gratitude can make everyone feel better in what would otherwise be quite a emotionally draining experience.\r\nMake A Safety Plan\r\nA safety plan is designed to guide you through a crisis. As you continue through the steps, you can get help and feel safer. Keep your plan easily accessible in case you have thoughts of hurting yourself.\r\n\n\r\n\n\nRecognize your personal warning signs: What thoughts, images, moods, situations, and behaviors indicate to you that a crisis may be developing? Write these down in your own words.\r\n\nUse your own coping strategies: List things that you can do on your own to help you not act on urges to harm yourself.\r\n\nSocialize with others who may offer support as well as distraction from the crisis: List people and social settings that may help take your mind off of difficult thoughts or feelings.\r\n\nContact family members or friends who may help to resolve a crisis: Make a list of people who are supportive and who you feel you can talk to when under stress.\r\n\nContact mental health professionals or agencies: Make a list of names, numbers and/or locations of clinicians, local emergency rooms, and crisis hotlines. Put the Lifeline number, 1-800-273-8255, into your phone.\r\n\nEnsure your environment is safe: Have you thought of ways in which you might harm yourself? Work with a counselor to develop a plan to limit your access to these means.\r\n\n\r\n\nPlanning ahead is a great idea! For example, I have a special Google Doc open on my laptop sometimes for in case I have an anxiety attack, with a breathing GIF, grounding exercises and other things.\r\nWhat sort of steps have you taken to manage suicidal tendencies? What resources worked for you and what didn\'t? Which of the above resources have you not tried yet, but wouldn\'t mind giving them a go?\r\nSelf Harm\r\nSelf Harm Alternatives\r\nFeeling angry: • Slash an empty plastic soda bottle or a piece of heavy cardboard or an old shirt or sock. • Squeeze ice. • Do something that will give you a sharp sensation, like eating lemon. • Make a soft cloth doll to represent the things you are angry at. Cut and tear it instead of yourself. • Flatten aluminum cans for recycling, seeing how fast you can go. • Hit a punching bag. • Pick up a stick and hit a tree. • Use a pillow to hit a wall, pillow-fight style.\r\nFeeling sad or depressed:• Do something slow and soothing.• Take a hot bath with bath oil or bubbles. • Curl up under a comforter with hot cocoa and a good book.• Baby yourself somehow. • Give yourself a present.• Hug a loved one or stuffed animal.• Play with a pet.• Make a list of things that make you happy.• Do something nice for someone else.• Light sweet-smelling incense. • Listen to soothing music.\r\nWe sourced these alternatives from http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/distraction-techniques-pm-2.pdf (The Cornell Research Program on Self Injury and Recovery) but only included a few. There\'s a lot more there if you\'d like to check them out for your own personal usage.\r\nQuestions you can ask yourself\r\n\r\n\nYou can ask yourself the following questions which may help you to identify the negative feelings or situations that lead to self-injury:• What was going on in my life when I first began to injure myself?• How do I feel just before I want to injure myself?• What are my habits and routines? Am I always in the same place or with a particular person when I get the urge to injure myself?• Do I always feel the same emotion when I get the urge to injure myself?• How can I better deal with the situations that trigger me? You may want to keep a diary in which you write down your feelings at different times so that you can better answer these questions.I want to stop self-injuring but I still have urges. What do I do instead?Distract yourself or use a substitution behavior. Many report that just delaying an urge to self-injure by several minutes can be enough to make the urge fade away. One way to increase the chances of a distraction or substitution helping calm the urge to self-injure is to match what you do to how you are feeling at the moment. It may be helpful to keep a list on hand so that when you get the urge to self-injure you can go down the list and find something that feels right to you in the moment.Source: http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/distraction-techniques-pm-2.pdf\n\r\n\r\n \r\n ',3,'2020-06-27 23:50:37','2020-06-27 23:50:37','resources-available-to-you','outcasts-suicide-and-self-harm','version','','',4),(70,10,'Understanding suicide and self harm','<p id=\"bkmrk-welcome-to-the-first\">Welcome to the first week of our Suicide and Self Harm Discussion &amp; Support Group on The Outcasts!

Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-when-you%27re-on-onlin\">When you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-depression-and-anxie\">Depression and Anxiety</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-depression-and-anxie-0\"><code>Depression</code> and <code>anxiety</code> are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-at-the-basic-level%2C-\">At the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-depression-as-a-mood\">\n<li>Depression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-these-terms-are-ofte\">These terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-similarly%2C-anxiety-c\">Similarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-anxiety-as-an-emotio\">\n<li>Anxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.</li>\r\n<li>Anxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-no-experience-of-dep\" class=\"callout info\">No experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-suicide\">Suicide</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk--0\"><a href=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/dnOg5sfG1keGySF5-image-1593159212409.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/dnOg5sfG1keGySF5-image-1593159212409.png\" alt=\"image-1593159212409.png\" width=\"407\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-people-who-are-suici\">People who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-just-because-your-co\" class=\"callout warning\">Just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; <strong>the pain is still the same.</strong></p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-terms-to-know\">Terms to know</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-you-don%27t-need-to-re\" class=\"callout info\">You don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicidal-ideation-is\"><strong>Suicidal ideation</strong> is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just <em>thinking</em> about it to making detailed plans. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicide-survivors-ar\"><strong>Suicide survivors</strong> are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicide-attempters-a\"><strong>Suicide attempters</strong> are people who have attempted suicide. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-recovery-is-a-term-w\"><strong>Recovery</strong> is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as <strong>survivors</strong> if they attempted suicide before. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-even-people-who-have\" class=\"callout info\">Even people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-self-harm\">Self Harm</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-people-self-harm-in-\">People self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. </p>\r\n<blockquote id=\"bkmrk-nonsuicidal-self-inj\">\r\n<p>Nonsuicidal self-injury (<span class=\"caps\">NSSI</span>) is the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue resulting in immediate damage, without suicidal intent and for purposes not culturally sanctioned.</p>\r\n<p>Self-injury can include a variety of behaviors but is most commonly associated with:</p>\r\n<p>◦ intentional carving or cutting of the skin<br>◦ subdermal tissue scratching<br>◦ burning oneself<br>◦ banging or punching objects or oneself with the intention of hurting oneself<br>◦ embedding objects under the skin</p>\r\n<p>Tattoos and body piercing are not typically considered self-injurious unless undertaken with the intention to harm the body.<br><br><em>Source: <a href=\"http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/about-self-injury.html\">http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/about-self-injury.html</a> </em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-often%2C-self-harm-in-\" class=\"callout info\">Often, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-terms-to-know-0\">Common self harming methods</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-there-are-usually-pl\">There are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-cutting-is-where-an-\"><strong>Cutting</strong> is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes <strong>habitual (recurring)</strong> and it is unhealthy.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-overdoses%C2%A0%28sometimes\"><strong>Burning</strong> occurs when people burn their skin. The health effects are still not too serious compared to say, an overdose, but they still do require First Aid and sometimes medical attention. </p>\r\n<p class=\"callout danger\" id=\"bkmrk-we-shouldn%27t-underes\">We shouldn\'t underestimate the negative health effects of self harm. While I\'ve stated that the health effects aren\'t serious <strong>provided First Aid is administered, leaving it too late can cause complications in the future.</strong><br><br>It\'s also worth noting that people who self harm might refuse First Aid treatment. In that case, it\'s important to tell them the reasons why looking after a wound or a cut is important.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-other-methods-includ\">Other methods include:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-burning-the-skin-hit\">\n<li>Overdosing on medication</li>\r\n<li>Hitting the body with fists or another object</li>\r\n<li>Punching walls or other objects</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-source%3A-https%3A%2F%2Fwww.\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\">https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm</a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-first-aid-informatio\" class=\"callout warning\">First Aid information:<br><br><strong>Cutting:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-wound\">https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-wound</a><strong><br></strong><strong>Overdose: </strong><a href=\"https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\">https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/</a></p>\r\n<hr id=\"bkmrk--1\">\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-severity\">Severity, and assessing our own conditions</h4>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-as-stated-above%2C-jus\" class=\"callout warning\">As stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-assessing-the-level-\">Assessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-even-without-a-diagn\">Even without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.</p>\r\n<blockquote id=\"bkmrk-1.-severity-of-ideat\">\r\n<h5>\n<strong>1. Severity of ideation</strong><br><strong>2. Intensity of ideation</strong><br><strong>3. Behaviour</strong><br><strong>4. Lethality</strong>\n</h5>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-alternatively%2C-if-th\">Alternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: <a href=\"https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\">https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/</a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk--2\"><a href=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/nhlyIxTjknflXuXC-image-1593161630018.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/nhlyIxTjknflXuXC-image-1593161630018.png\" alt=\"image-1593161630018.png\"></a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-%C2%A0\">When it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-on-your-own%2C-you-mig\" class=\"callout success\">On your own, you might like to assess the severity and risk of suicide and self harm with you personally. If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-soars\">\n<strong>Case Study:</strong> SOARS</h5>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-soars-stands-for%C2%A0sui\">The SOARS model stands for <strong>S</strong>uicidal ideation; <strong>O</strong>nset, Frequency and Methods;  <strong>A</strong>ftercare; <strong>R</strong>easons and <strong>S</strong>tage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-suicidal-ideation\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Suicidal ideation</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-you-probably-already\">You probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-onset%2C-frequency-and\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Onset, Frequency and Methods</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-someone-who-cuts-3-t\">Someone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-aftercare\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Aftercare</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-the-way-you-treat-yo\">The way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-reasons\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Reasons</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-many-of-us-self-harm\">Many of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-you-might-like-to-di\" class=\"callout success\">You might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-stage-of-change\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Stage of Change</strong></span></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-many-of-those-who-se\">Many of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"bkmrk-over-to-you-now%3A%C2%A0if-\" class=\"callout success\">\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Over to you</strong></span><br><br><strong>If you self harm</strong>, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?<br><br><strong>If you don\'t self harm</strong>, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be?

Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time.

It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\n\r\nNonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue resulting in immediate damage, without suicidal intent and for purposes not culturally sanctioned.\r\nSelf-injury can include a variety of behaviors but is most commonly associated with:\r\n◦ intentional carving or cutting of the skin◦ subdermal tissue scratching◦ burning oneself◦ banging or punching objects or oneself with the intention of hurting oneself◦ embedding objects under the skin\r\nTattoos and body piercing are not typically considered self-injurious unless undertaken with the intention to harm the body.Source: http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/about-self-injury.html \r\n\r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor. Usually, the health effects aren\'t too serious provided they\'re managed promptly, and you can find information on First Aid for the physical injury caused. That being said, it is a very common self harming method that becomes habitual (recurring) and it is unhealthy.\r\nBurning occurs when people burn their skin. The health effects are still not too serious compared to say, an overdose, but they still do require First Aid and sometimes medical attention. \r\nWe shouldn\'t underestimate the negative health effects of self harm. While I\'ve stated that the health effects aren\'t serious provided First Aid is administered, leaving it too late can cause complications in the future.It\'s also worth noting that people who self harm might refuse First Aid treatment. In that case, it\'s important to tell them the reasons why looking after a wound or a cut is important.\r\nOther methods include:\r\n\nOverdosing on medication\r\nHitting the body with fists or another object\r\nPunching walls or other objects\r\n\nSource: https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/self-harm\r\nFirst Aid information:Cutting: https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-clean-a-woundOverdose: https://www.stjohn.org.nz/First-Aid/First-Aid-Library/Overdose--Drugs-and-Alcohol/\r\n\nSeverity, and assessing our own conditions\r\nAs stated above, just because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important.\r\nAssessing the level of risk of ourselves and others lies on the foundation of assessing how severe our suicide ideation or self harm habits are.\r\nEven without a diagnosis, assessing the level of risk you\'re at can be a good way to see where you\'re at. However, suicide risk assessments like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) names four constructs or indices that highlight the risk a person is to suicide.\r\n\r\n\n1. Severity of ideation2. Intensity of ideation3. Behaviour4. Lethality\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the above seems too complex, you might prefer a simpler way to rate your condition. We\'ve borrowed the following diagram from the CheckPoint mental health charity for gamers: https://checkpointorg.com/suicidal-thoughts/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to self harm though, it\'s much harder to measure the severity of it though. Usually it\'s accompanied by other conditions too. So, there\'s been a few scientific models to measure the severity of non-suicidal, self-harm.\r\nOn your own, you might like to assess the severity and risk of suicide and self harm with you personally. If you\'d like to talk with someone about it though, feel free to chat in our designated Discord channel.\r\n\nCase Study: SOARS\r\nThe SOARS model stands for Suicidal ideation; Onset, Frequency and Methods;  Aftercare; Reasons and Stage of Change. I\'ll briefly outline some of the key points of this model below.\r\nSuicidal ideation\r\nYou probably already realise this, but although self harm and suicide are linked, they aren\'t directly attributed to each other. That being said, there is a connection between the two. That\'s why we\'ve grouped these two topics into one support group, because healing yourself in one area can help you improve in other similar ones too.\r\nOnset, Frequency and Methods\r\nSomeone who cuts 3 times every month for a few minutes probably has a less severe case of self harm than someone who cuts almost daily. Understanding where your situation lies is a great first step towards setting realistic goals for yourself. Furthermore, as we mentioned above different methods have different levels of risk. While all self harm methods cause injury, something like a drug overdose can be far more dangerous than cutting. \r\nAftercare\r\nThe way you treat your wounds and seek for help is important to both your physical and mental wellbeing. Looking after yourself, even after self harm, is really important and different people have different attitudes to aftercare, like administering first aid after cutting. \r\nReasons\r\nMany of us self harm because it offers a distraction from pain elsewhere, but why? What pushes us to hurt ourselves?\r\nYou might like to discuss this with the support group on Discord, but only if you feel comfortable.\r\nStage of Change\r\nMany of those who self harm feel compelled to get better. Someone who is trying to limit the amount of self harm they do is in a better position to recover, than those who find no hope in limiting self harm.\r\n\nOver to youIf you self harm, which of these areas do you think you could improve in? What goals would you like to set for yourself in the future?If you don\'t self harm, what do you think the best way of supporting someone would be? How could you address improvements in different specific areas?Leave your ideas and be involved with the conversation in the allocated Discord channel for our group!\n\r\nSource: https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/soars-model-risk-assessment-nonsuicidal-self-injury\r\nWe\'ll be going through risk assessment more in the future, so this is just a quick primer.

As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.</p>\r\n<p>These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Background</li>\r\n<li>Family status</li>\r\n<li>Gender</li>\r\n<li>Gender identity or expression</li>\r\n<li>Marital status</li>\r\n<li>Sex</li>\r\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\r\n<li>Native language</li>\r\n<li>Age</li>\r\n<li>Ability</li>\r\n<li>Race and/or ethnicity</li>\r\n<li>Caste</li>\r\n<li>National origin</li>\r\n<li>Socioeconomic status</li>\r\n<li>Religion</li>\r\n<li>Geographic location</li>\r\n<li>Any other dimension of diversity</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-when-and-how-to-use-\"><h2>When and How to Use These Guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as users of OSCAR TechNet, including in:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>published content;</li>\r\n<li>the Comments section;</li>\r\n<li>user profiles;</li>\r\n<li>and any use of OSCAR\'s information technology systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>While these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at interaction on TechNet, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of OSCAR’s online spaces to have a deep impact on community health. This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-expected-behavior-th\"><h2>Expected Behavior</h2>\r\n<p>The following behaviors are expected of all users of OSCAR TechNet:</p>\r\n<h3>Be Respectful</h3>\r\n<p>Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.</p>\r\n<h3>Be Direct but Professional</h3>\r\n<p>We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.</p>\r\n<h3>Be Inclusive</h3>\r\n<p>Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.</p>\r\n<p>Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Remote (on video or phone)</li>\r\n<li>Not native language speakers</li>\r\n<li>Coming from a different culture</li>\r\n<li>Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”</li>\r\n<li>Living in a different time zone</li>\r\n<li>Facing other challenges to participate</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand Different Perspectives</h3>\r\n<p>Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.</p>\r\n<h3>Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences</h3>\r\n<p>We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.</p>\r\n<h3>Lead by Example</h3>\r\n<p>By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.</p>\r\n</section><section id=\"bkmrk-behavior-that-will-n\"><h2>Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated</h2>\r\n<p>The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.</p>\r\n<h3>Violence and Threats of Violence</h3>\r\n<p>Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.</p>\r\n<h3>Personal Attacks</h3>\r\n<p>Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.</p>\r\n<h3>Derogatory Language</h3>\r\n<p>Hurtful or harmful language related to:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"mzp-u-list-styled\">\n<li>Background</li>\r\n<li>Family status</li>\r\n<li>Gender</li>\r\n<li>Gender identity or expression</li>\r\n<li>Marital status</li>\r\n<li>Sex</li>\r\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\r\n<li>Native language</li>\r\n<li>Age</li>\r\n<li>Ability</li>\r\n<li>Race and/or ethnicity</li>\r\n<li>Caste</li>\r\n<li>National origin</li>\r\n<li>Socioeconomic status</li>\r\n<li>Religion</li>\r\n<li>Geographic location</li>\r\n<li>Other attributes</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.</p>\r\n<h3>Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact</h3>\r\n<p>Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos.

Last updated 25 June 2020.\r\nBy using the OSCAR TechNet service you agree to the latest version of these Community Guidelines.\r\nOSCAR TechNet welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.\r\nThese guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nAny other dimension of diversity\r\n\nOpenness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.\r\nWhen and How to Use These Guidelines\r\nThese guidelines outline our behavior expectations as users of OSCAR TechNet, including in:\r\n\npublished content;\r\nthe Comments section;\r\nuser profiles;\r\nand any use of OSCAR\'s information technology systems.\r\n\nWhile these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at interaction on TechNet, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of OSCAR’s online spaces to have a deep impact on community health. This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nThe following behaviors are expected of all users of OSCAR TechNet:\r\nBe Respectful\r\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\r\nBe Direct but Professional\r\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\r\nBe Inclusive\r\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\r\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\r\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\r\nNot native language speakers\r\nComing from a different culture\r\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\r\nLiving in a different time zone\r\nFacing other challenges to participate\r\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\r\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\r\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\r\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\r\nWe all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\r\nLead by Example\r\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for the mission towards a better Internet.\r\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\r\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\r\nViolence and Threats of Violence\r\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.\r\nPersonal Attacks\r\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\r\nDerogatory Language\r\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\r\n\nBackground\r\nFamily status\r\nGender\r\nGender identity or expression\r\nMarital status\r\nSex\r\nSexual orientation\r\nNative language\r\nAge\r\nAbility\r\nRace and/or ethnicity\r\nCaste\r\nNational origin\r\nSocioeconomic status\r\nReligion\r\nGeographic location\r\nOther attributes\r\n\nis not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.\r\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\r\nUnwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.\r\nDisruptive Behavior\r\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\r\n\n‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.\r\nDrinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.\r\nMaking derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.\r\nOtherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.\r\n\nInfluencing Unacceptable Behavior\r\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\r\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior\r\nBad behavior from any user, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from OSCAR TechNet are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.\r\nReports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.\r\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.\r\nOSCAR Staff are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to OSCAR’s internal policies. OSCAR Staff in violation of these guidelines may be subject to further consequences.\r\nIn addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.\r\nSigning up for an account\r\nLike most platforms, while anyone is free to browse and view the content published on TechNet, you should be at least 13 years old, or the age of majority in your local jurisdiction (whichever is most applicable) to maintain an account on TechNet.\r\nAccounts that violate this rule may be terminated.\r\nReporting\r\nIf you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please contact us using the Contact Details below.\r\nAfter receiving a concise description of your situation, we will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately address each situation.\r\nPlease also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.\r\nIf you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.\r\nAsk questions\r\nEveryone is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines. If you are organizing an event or activity, reach out for tips building inclusion for your event, activity or space. Your input is welcome and we will try to provide a response within 2 days.

I\'m a 15 year old boy who lives in Sydney, Australia, and I enjoy messing around with computers, watching anime, and helping people out when they\'re in a tough time. I\'ve been on peer support communities like Outcasts for quite a while now (over a year) but have been hanging out on the internet for much longer. I spent my time on platforms like YouTube and Reddit, and when I was younger did a lot of online multiplayer gaming on Roblox. It wouldn\'t be too bad if I could do something like that again, in retrospect.

I won\'t go into detail, but I encountered depression at a very young age, and was eventually hospitalised for suicide.

I still am desensitised to death and dark thoughts. And despite my young age, I have been through a lot of things, a lot of things that not many people know about. So the reason I\'m investing this time into engaging others who have been through our shared experiences, is so that everyone can find a way out of this dark hole.

Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-when-you%27re-on-onlin\">When you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-depression-and-anxie\">Depression and Anxiety</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-depression-and-anxie-0\"><code>Depression</code> and <code>anxiety</code> are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.</p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-at-the-basic-level%2C-\">At the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-depression-as-a-mood\">\n<li>Depression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-these-terms-are-ofte\">These terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. </p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-similarly%2C-anxiety-c\">Similarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):</p>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-anxiety-as-an-emotio\">\n<li>Anxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.</li>\r\n<li>Anxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-no-experience-of-dep\" class=\"callout info\">No experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"bkmrk-suicide\">Suicide</h4>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk--0\"><a href=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/dnOg5sfG1keGySF5-image-1593159212409.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://technet.adrian.id.au/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/dnOg5sfG1keGySF5-image-1593159212409.png\" alt=\"image-1593159212409.png\" width=\"407\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-people-who-are-suici\">People who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses.

This week is an opportunity for everyone to get a feel of the format and the way these discussion groups will be run.\r\nThis week we\'ll break the ice with a relatively easy to understand topic. We\'ll discuss suicide and self harm from a general point of view and understand the different definitions and conditions that characterise suicide and self harm, as well as the resources available in our communities to manage suicide. Hopefully this week we learn something new about how we view suicidal and self harming tendencies, and as a result we\'ll all hopefully understand our conditions a little bit more.\r\nIf you have any suggestions at any time, feel free to contact me on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805)\r\nDo you need urgent help, or do you think you\'re going to hurt yourself now?  Reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\n\nUnderstanding different conditions\r\nIf you go to a resources website or visit a therapist, they might use different terms to refer to different levels or severity of suicide. Although you might know what some of these terms mean vaguely, I\'d like to take the opportunity to clarify on *exactly* what these terms mean.\r\nWhen you\'re on online support communities like Outcasts you\'ll find a lot of different disorders with names (typically pulled from the DSM-5 - the industry-standard guide to different mental disorders and illnesses). But, here, we\'ll just scrape the tip of the iceberg and we won\'t go into other disorders.\r\nDepression and Anxiety\r\nDepression and anxiety are two commonly used words we hear all the time when our problems are being discussed. However, they\'re quite general, so here are some great definitions from different sources that you might want to familiarise yourself with.\r\nAt the basic level, depression could be classified into two categories:\r\n\nDepression as a mood  - where we feel sad and withdraw from our favourite activities for a period of time. Most people experience depression at some point in their lives, like after losing a family member.\r\nClinical depression - a mental disorder characterised by symptoms, including depressive mood, for an extended period of time. It is also known as Major Depressive Disorder. \r\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but it\'s important to understand the difference. Furthermore, there is a lot of different subtypes of depression which we won\'t go into now. \r\nSimilarly, anxiety can also be split into two categories (when it comes down to day-to-day general usage):\r\n\nAnxiety as an emotion - when we\'re feeling nervous or we are dreading something.\r\nAnxiety as a disorder - disorders that are, like clinical depression, characterised by symptoms, including anxiety emotion, for an extended period of time. Common anxiety disorders include General Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.\r\n\nNo experience of depression or anxiety ever the same. They differ in severity, impact, causes, and effects. It\'s important to note that it can take many different styles, and your experience will be different from others. That being said, they are often many different identifiable symptoms to help you recognise whether you experience a disorder linked to your mood and wellbeing.\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nPeople who are suicidal vary from those who are vaguely thinking about killing themselves, to those who are intent on a specific plan. The different levels of severity, different combinations of other conditions, and different responses. And it should be, because every life is unique, and every person will experience suicide slightly differently to the next.\r\nJust because your condition or situation might not seem as severe or bad as others, doesn\'t make it any less important. It doesn\'t matter whether you\'re drowning in a small pond or you\'re drowning in the middle of a huge ocean; the pain is still the same.\r\nTerms to know\r\nYou don\'t need to read through this section if you already know what these terms mean.\r\nSuicidal ideation is the term we use when we talk about people planning, thinking about, or considering suicide. Again, the extent of ideation varies from just thinking about it to making detailed plans. \r\nSuicide survivors are family and friends who have lost someone to suicide. \r\nSuicide attempters are people who have attempted suicide. \r\nRecovery is a term we use to describe those who no longer experience the condition(s) they once used to. They might also be referred to as survivors if they attempted suicide before. \r\nEven people who have recovered (like me) still experience the effects post-suicide.  For example, I sometimes get random anxiety attacks, and I\'m really desensitised to dark thoughts (you might recall I said this in the Introduction)\r\nSelf Harm\r\nPeople self harm in lots of different ways. It\'s usually used as a coping mechanism or a distraction from other pain. \r\n\r\nNonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue resulting in immediate damage, without suicidal intent and for purposes not culturally sanctioned.\r\nSelf-injury can include a variety of behaviors but is most commonly associated with:\r\n◦ intentional carving or cutting of the skin◦ subdermal tissue scratching◦ burning oneself◦ banging or punching objects or oneself with the intention of hurting oneself◦ embedding objects under the skin\r\nTattoos and body piercing are not typically considered self-injurious unless undertaken with the intention to harm the body.Source: http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/about-self-injury.html \r\n\r\nOften, self harm in the medical community is abbreviated to NSSI – non-suicidal self injury. We won\'t use that term much here but you might encounter it elsewhere.\r\nCommon self harming methods\r\nThere are usually plenty of different self harm methods, but two in particular are highly common. \r\nCutting is where an individual deliberately cuts themselves with a sharp object, like a knife or razor.

You probably know about many of these already, but different prevention techniques work differently for different people, so take a look at these and go over...\r\n\nWhich resources you use often\r\nWhich resources don\'t really work for you\r\nWhich resources you haven\'t tried yet\r\n\nA lot of this content is just a quick intro to the sort of resources we\'ll be looking at over the coming weeks. By no means is this all there is!\r\nThere\'s always help available if you\'re struggling. You can always reach out for help at a professional suicide helpline here: suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.htmlAustralia: 13 11 14Canada: 1883-456-4566New Zealand: 0508 828 865United Kingdom and Rep. of Ireland: 116 123United States: 1800-273-8255\r\nSuicide\r\n\r\nAll of the content here (except for annotations) is taken directly from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\'s \'Help Yourself\' website page available at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-yourself/ \r\n\r\nFind A Therapist/Support Group\r\nSpeaking to someone, whether by going to a therapist or by attending a support group, can help you feel better and improve your mental health. These resources can help you find a psychologist, psychiatrist, or support group near you.\r\nWe\'ve all probably had different experiences with therapy or support groups. For me personally, I didn\'t really take therapy too seriously and lied in order to be let go quicker. If you\'re comfortable, you might like to discuss your personal experiences with therapy/irl support groups and what worked for you (and what didn\'t).\r\nBuild A Support Network\r\nYou don\'t have to deal with crisis on your own. Those you choose to confide in can provide encouragement and help you through a crisis.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour World\r\nYou are part of a larger whole, and you matter. You may feel less isolated when you’re connected more to others. Consider joining an interest group, volunteering, taking a class, or starting a new hobby.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Social Networks\r\nSocial media is a place to share how you’re feeling and hear the stories of others who have felt the same. Connecting to people through technology may help you remember that you are not alone, and you may find others with similar interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Community\r\nWhether your community is at work, school, church, or a club or a team, having a group of people who encourage help-seeking and support  is one of the most important aspects of suicide prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Circle Of Trust\r\nRelationships with friends, family, and significant others built on trust and companionship are a protective factor against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. It’s important to find the people in your life that you can always confide in, feel comfortable around, and can contact at any time. Surround yourself with positive people who motivate you to be your best.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nWhat support networks do you have available to you now? Who do you trust, and in which areas would you like to improve?\r\nUse Your Support Network\r\nLeaning on your support network can help you cope during difficult moments and is an important step in getting help and moving forward.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nExpress Yourself\r\nDuring difficult situations, it’s natural to shut down, but keeping your emotions bottled up makes it harder for your support network to help you. Reach out to people you trust who have the ability to be sympathetic and non-judgmental.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep an Open Mind\r\nKeep in mind that the advice and support of others come from a good place. We may not necessarily agree with advice we’re given, but staying open-minded and receptive to outside perspectives and opinions can help strengthen your support network.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Appreciation\r\nThe people in your support network will stick with you through thick and thin, but it’s also important to remember that friendships and relationships are a two-way street. Express your appreciation for the love and support that these special people bring into your life.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThis is really important too. Many of us would also have experienced hardships and frustrations when supporting others sometimes, and even just showing gratitude can make everyone feel better in what would otherwise be quite a emotionally draining experience.\r\nMake A Safety Plan\r\nA safety plan is designed to guide you through a crisis. As you continue through the steps, you can get help and feel safer. Keep your plan easily accessible in case you have thoughts of hurting yourself.\r\n\n\r\n\n\nRecognize your personal warning signs: What thoughts, images, moods, situations, and behaviors indicate to you that a crisis may be developing? Write these down in your own words.\r\n\nUse your own coping strategies: List things that you can do on your own to help you not act on urges to harm yourself.\r\n\nSocialize with others who may offer support as well as distraction from the crisis: List people and social settings that may help take your mind off of difficult thoughts or feelings.\r\n\nContact family members or friends who may help to resolve a crisis: Make a list of people who are supportive and who you feel you can talk to when under stress.\r\n\nContact mental health professionals or agencies: Make a list of names, numbers and/or locations of clinicians, local emergency rooms, and crisis hotlines. Put the Lifeline number, 1-800-273-8255, into your phone.\r\n\nEnsure your environment is safe: Have you thought of ways in which you might harm yourself? Work with a counselor to develop a plan to limit your access to these means.\r\n\n\r\n\nPlanning ahead is a great idea! For example, I have a special Google Doc open on my laptop sometimes for in case I have an anxiety attack, with a breathing GIF, grounding exercises and other things.\r\nWhat sort of steps have you taken to manage suicidal tendencies? What resources worked for you and what didn\'t?

There\'s a lot more there if you\'d like to check them out for your own personal usage.\r\nQuestions you can ask yourself\r\n\r\n\nYou can ask yourself the following questions which may help you to identify the negative feelings or situations that lead to self-injury:• What was going on in my life when I first began to injure myself?• How do I feel just before I want to injure myself?• What are my habits and routines? Am I always in the same place or with a particular person when I get the urge to injure myself?• Do I always feel the same emotion when I get the urge to injure myself?• How can I better deal with the situations that trigger me?
